# myVIM-configurations

Repository containing my personal vim/neovim configurations

## VIM

Whithin the folder [vim](vim) it is located my (**barely mantained**) [.vimrc](vim/VIMRC). It was based on [Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) as a plugin manager.

## NEOVIM

The neovim folder is currently under dev since I use on a daily basis neovim. It is divided in two subfolders named after the two plugins manager that I used.

- [Packer](neovim/packer) is the folder contaning my neovim setup with packer as a plugin manager(**No longer mantained**).
- [Lazy](neovim/lazy) is the folder contaning my neovim setup with lazy as a package manager (**Something is missing for shure**).
