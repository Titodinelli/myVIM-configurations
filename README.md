## NEOVIM

The neovim folder is currently under dev since I use on a daily basis neovim. It is divided in two subfolders named after the two plugins manager that I used.

- [Lazy](neovim/lazy) is the folder contaning my neovim setup with lazy as a package manager (**Something is missing for sure**).
