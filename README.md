# dotfiles

Repository containing my personal dotfiles, managed using [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).
Always **WIP**, and not always updated. Next steps:
- Migrate to XDG coherent structure, in order to ease ubuntu synchronization.
- Add *.ssh*, *.git*.
- Comment better everything.

## Something to check at least to me.
